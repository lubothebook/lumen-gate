//! Boot-time cross-check of the canonical check programs (the prover-side
//! half of the bit-for-bit story).
//!
//! The regeneration gate (the base project `xtask/gates`) independently reproduces the
//! canonical programs and pins their Keccak-256 hashes; the ZKVM verifier
//! holds the same pin table in `canonical_set`. This module closes the third
//! corner: a zkl-zero process that proves or verifies attests the agreement
//! itself, at boot, before it touches a proof. Any drift refuses the run.
//!
//! The check is deliberately duplicated logic, not shared code. The `zk-vm`
//! builder walks the schema from the register allocation up; this module
//! walks it from the pinned operand values down; the gate carries its own
//! copy. Three independent derivations that agree are the property - a
//! shared helper would be one point of failure restated three times.
