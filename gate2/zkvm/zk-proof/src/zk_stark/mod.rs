//! This is a fork carrying local modifications rather than an independent
//! implementation: the module layout matches upstream and roughly two thirds
//! of the prover and verifier lines are shared with `p3-uni-stark 0.6.2`.
//! Recorded here because Apache-2.0 requires attribution to travel with a
//! derivative work, and because a reader comparing this code against the
//! upstream deserves to know it is looking at a fork.
//!
//! Local changes concentrate in `folder.rs` (constraint folding for the the prover
//! VM AIR) and in the proof/config types; see `docs/PROVENANCE_NOTES.md` for
//! the measurement this claim rests on.
