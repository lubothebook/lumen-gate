//! Relay of canonical-production consensus results (R1, 2026-08-28).
//!
//! The regeneration gate (the base project `xtask/gates`) independently reproduces the
//! canonical programs and pins their hashes; the ZKVM verifier holds the same
//! set in `canonical_set`. This module is the proof-side half of the relay:
//! it verifies a proof against the canonical set, turns the outcome into a
//! deterministic, keccak-signed JSON report (status, tokens, timestamp), and
//! emits a machine-readable `relay-token` line.
//!
//! The signature is Keccak-256 over a canonical byte payload of the report
//! fields (fixed field order, little-endian integers, raw hash bytes, ASCII
//! strings NUL-terminated). It needs no key: anyone can recompute the payload
//! from the report and check `report_sig`, which makes the report verifiable
//! by an external monitor without trusting the producer.
//!
//! The gate-side consumer (`relay` gate in the base project xtask) reads this same
//! report format, compares the canonical-set token against its own
//! regeneration (diverse double compiling), and writes the signed
//! `relay-status.json` it ships to external watchers.
