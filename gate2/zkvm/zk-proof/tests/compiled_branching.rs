//! FINDING: the conditional branching the compiler emits could not be proven.
//!
//! Measured with a live `zk-cli run`: EVERY program containing a branch gave
//! "Verification of generated proof failed!", while straight-line programs
//! passed.
//!
//!   example.zkl      (no Jmp/Jnz, 22 steps) -> VALID
//!   example2.zkl     (no Jmp/Jnz, 16 steps) -> VALID
//!   long.zkl         (no Jmp/Jnz, 19 steps) -> VALID
//!   if_only.zkl      (Jnz + Jmp)            -> FAILED
//!   short_loop.zkl   (Jnz + Jmp)            -> FAILED
//!   control_flow.zkl (Jnz + Jmp)            -> FAILED
//!   example_loop.zkl (Jnz + Jmp)            -> FAILED
//!
//! (`long.zkl`, `if_only.zkl` and `short_loop.zkl` were written by hand for
//! that measurement and are not kept in the tree; the other four are.)
//!
//! Comparing the bytecode settled the distinction: the opcode set of the
//! failing programs contains `Jnz` and `Jmp`, and the passing ones contain
//! neither. So the problem is not the trace length but branching itself -- a
//! straight 19 step program passes while a two-iteration loop fails.
//!
//! The existing 106 prover tests had fallen into this gap: they all prove
//! HAND-BUILT instruction sequences (`inst(Opcode::Jnz, ...)`), and none of
//! them proves the compiler's actual output. When a hand-built Jnz passes but a
//! compiled Jnz fails, the difference is not in the instruction itself but in
//! what surrounds it: the pc target, the call frame, the register allocation.
//!
//! This test closes that gap: it starts from source code, runs the compiler,
//! executes the result on the VM and verifies the proof that was PRODUCED.
