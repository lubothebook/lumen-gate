// -- The real soundness measurement (2026-08-23) --------------------------
//
// The tests here replaced a `tampered_check_fails` harness. That harness was
// measured and it **never measured a constraint**: `p3_air::check_constraints`
// panics on the very first row for this AIR for two reasons -
//
//   1. `num_public_values()` returned 56 while the harness passed an array of
//      length 48 -> "index out of bounds: the len is 48 but the index is 48".
//   2. even after that is fixed the AIR wants permutation (lookup) data ->
//      "permutation() called on a builder created without permutation data".
//
// `catch_unwind(...).is_err()` did not tell those panics apart from a
// constraint violation, so it returned `true` **even when no tampering had been
// applied at all** (measured). All five negative tests were therefore green for
// the wrong reason and provided no assurance about the AIR.
//
// `zk_stark::prover` had already reached the same conclusion: the
// `check_constraints` call there stands behind both `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`
// and `if !has_aux_trace` - that API is not enough for this AIR.
//
// So the tests below measure through **prove + verify** rather than the AIR
// directly: a valid proof is produced, then a single thing is changed and the
// verifier is expected to refuse it. That is the attack surface the chain is
// really exposed to - the claim presented to the verifier.
