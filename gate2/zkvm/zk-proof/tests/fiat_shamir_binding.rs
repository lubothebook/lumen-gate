//! Fiat-Shamir binding order in the in-tree STARK.
//!
//! Six zkVMs were found in March 2026 to share one root cause: a
//! prover-controlled value that affects a verification equation was not
//! absorbed into the transcript before the challenges were derived. With the
//! challenges fixed independently of that value, a malicious prover picks the
//! value *after* seeing them and solves for one that satisfies the check. The
//! fix in every case was one or two lines; finding it meant asking, of each
//! input, "what if the prover chose this after the challenge?"
//!
//! `zk_stark` is our own verifier, not a dependency, so that question applies
//! here directly. It is currently answered correctly:
//!
//!   prover.rs:184    challenger.observe_slice(public_values);
//!   prover.rs:223    let alpha = challenger.sample_algebra_element();
//!
//!   verifier.rs:352  challenger.observe_slice(public_values);
//!   verifier.rs:356  let rand_1 = challenger.sample_algebra_element();
//!
//! Public values go in before any challenge comes out, on both sides, and the
//! instance data and commitments precede them in the same order.
//!
//! Nothing was pinning that. These tests read both files and fail if the
//! observe/sample order changes; breaking soundness here
//! is a *reordering* - it compiles, every existing test passes, and proofs
//! still verify against an honest prover. Only a malicious prover notices.
//!
//! The permutation challenges (rand_1..3) are also derived after the public
//! values, and alpha and zeta after their respective commitments; a
//! source-level check is the only thing that can catch those moving without a
//! full adversarial prover harness.
