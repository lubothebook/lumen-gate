//! Canonical private-transfer verification program.
//!
//! The privacy trio - `PrivacyCommit` (0x20), `SumConservation` (0x22),
//! `NullifierCheck` (0x21) - is fully supported by the VM and the AIR, but no
//! production code ever combined them into a canonical program. This module
//! fixes that: a single canonical program that exercises all three in order,
//! so the AIR rows that implement them are attested by the regeneration gate
//! just like the storage challenge and the AI matmul guest.
//!
//! The program is a *schema*: the amounts, blinding, recipient tag, sums,
//! claimed nullifier and secret are canonical constants, so every node
//! reproduces the same instruction stream (convergence). Parameterising the
//! values from memory is a later slice; the identity of the program - the
//! instruction stream - is what the canonical hash binds.
//!
//! Register allocation (all below the 32-bit `imm` ceiling on purpose):
//!   r1 = amount, r2 = blinding, r3 = recipient tag (imm of PrivacyCommit)
//!   r4 = commitment output, r5 = sum_in, r6 = sum_out, r7 = conservation flag
//!   r8 = claimed nullifier, r9 = secret, r10 = nullifier flag
