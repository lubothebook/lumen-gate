//! How a privacy note's field element becomes a 32-byte hash, defined once.
//!
//! The zkVM produces Goldilocks field elements. The chain stores 32-byte
//! hashes. Something has to say how one becomes the other, and until this
//! crate existed three places said it independently:
//!
//! - `zkzero/zk-state/src/note.rs`, where the zkVM state layer builds a
//!   `PrivacyNote` out of the commitment and nullifier the VM computed,
//! - `wallet-core/src/privacy_crypto.rs`, where the wallet builds the same
//!   two values before it signs a transfer,
//! - `src/privacy/note_registry.rs`, which stores neither field elements nor
//!   the packing itself, but consumes its output as `NoteHash` and compares
//!   it for equality against what the wallet sent.
//!
//! The three agreed. Nothing made them agree. The failure that shape invites
//! is not a compile error and not a failing test: if the wallet's packing and
//! the chain's packing ever diverge by one byte, the wallet computes a
//! nullifier the chain has never seen, `is_nullifier_spent` answers false for
//! a note that was already spent, and `contains_commitment` answers false for
//! a note that exists. The transfer is refused, or worse, accepted twice. The
//! money is gone quietly, and every individual crate's tests still pass,
//! because each one tests its own copy against itself.
//!
//! A round-trip test does not catch it either. Each copy round-trips
//! perfectly; that is exactly the property a copy preserves while drifting.
//! Only a single definition removes the failure, so this crate is the
//! definition and the other three call it.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! A field element occupies the low eight bytes, little-endian. The upper
//! twenty-four bytes are zero. This is a packing, not a hash: it is
//! injective, reversible, and carries no collision resistance of its own. The
//! collision resistance belongs to the Poseidon call that produced the field
//! element in the first place.
//!
//! # Why the high bytes are zero rather than a domain tag
//!
//! Zero padding means the hash space of packed notes is a sparse subset of
//! the full 32-byte space, which is a virtue here: the note subtree is
//! isolated from the account, NFT, B.U.D. and Pollen state, so a packed note
//! hash cannot be confused with a hash from another subtree by construction
//! rather than by convention. A domain tag in the high bytes would add
//! nothing this isolation does not already provide, and would silently
//! invalidate every note already recorded under the current rule.
